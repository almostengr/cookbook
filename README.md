# Cookbook
No code. Just recipes and food ideas.

## Purpose 

Why use Git and Github for food recipes? 

The answer is that recipes can change based upon the available ingredients.
By using Git, it allows you to track those changes and look back to see which
combination of ingredients tasted well and which did not.

## Conventions 

To make things easier, the following conventions or rules are followed with 
each recipe: 
* Refain from using cooking (olive, vegetable, canola) oil unless specified.
* Substitute the seasonings with others of your choosing. For example, if you 
prefer to use low calorie sweetener instead of sugar, then go ahead.
* All measurements and cooking times are estimations. If you live in 
an area of high altitude or have a medical condition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension)
which requires monitoring your intake of certain foods, then please feel free 
to adjust them to your preference.

Suggestions for modifications to recipes can be made by adding 
and issue to this project.

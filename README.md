# Cookbook
No code. Just recipes and food ideas.

# Purpose 

Why use Git and Github for food recipes? 

The answer is that recipes can change based upon the available ingredients.
By using Git, it allows you to track those changes and look back to see which
combination of ingredients tasted well and which did not.


Suggestions for modifications to recipes can be made by adding 
and issue to this project.

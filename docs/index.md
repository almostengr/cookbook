# Welcome to The Cookbook

This website, contains recipes for things that you can eat.

You can use the navigation on the left to find a recipe in the category that you choose or use the search
in the upper left to find recipes across all categories.

## Straight To The Point Recipes

Nobody really cares how succulent, moist, or dedicant you think the recipe is. They just want to know what
ingredients to buy so that they can make this recipe.
Thus to make this website simple and straight to the point, this website will not have all that filler
text before you see the recipe. Just ingredients, directions, and maybe ads... that's it.

## Seasonings

Often times, I do not specify the seasonings on a recipe. The reason being is because each persons preference 
of seasonings will vary and that I stock different seasonings in my cabinet. May use one seasoning for 
a meal and a different seasoning for the same meal on a different time.

## Unit Conversions

Units are by default, done in Imperial (US) units and converted to Metric.
